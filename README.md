<p>Over the last few years, several pre-trained language models and transfer learning techniques have been proposed and led to a significant performance improvement across various natural language understanding (NLU) tasks. Although several NLU benchmark models have been introduced in order to evaluate the effectiveness of such pre-trained models and techniques. <br>
<b>ORCA</b> is a large-scale ARabic Language Understanding and Evaluation benchmark styled after ARLUE (AbdulMageed et al., 2021) with a new set of publicly available NLU tasks and datasets. It's composed of 60 publicly available datasets and covers seven NLU task clusters. Moreover, we provide a deep comprehensive comparison of the performance of all recently released Arabic pre-trained language models on <b>ORCA</b>  benchmark. </p>
  
# How to use

## Install Requirments
```shell
    pip install datasets transformers seqeval
```
## Fine-tuning a model on ORCA tasks
We provide a Google's Colab Notbook that has an instructions for fine-tunining any model on ORCA dtasks. <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/UBC-NLP/orca/blob/main/Finetuning_ORCA.ipynb.ipynb"><img alt="colab" src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg">
